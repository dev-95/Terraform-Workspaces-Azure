Terraform Multi-Environment Setup with Workspaces
This project demonstrates how to manage multiple Azure environments (Dev and Test) using a single Terraform codebase. By utilizing Terraform Workspaces and Variables, the architecture remains "DRY" (Don't Repeat Yourself), ensuring consistency across environments while isolating state files.

🚀 Project Objectives
Implement dynamic resource naming using terraform.workspace.

Manage infrastructure variables for Azure Resource Groups and Virtual Networks.

Demonstrate environment isolation through state management.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Cloud Provider: Azure

IaC Tool: Terraform

Version Control: Git

📂 File Structure
main.tf: Defines the Azure Resource Group and Virtual Network.

variables.tf: Declares input variables for naming, location, and IP addressing.

outputs.tf: Displays Resource Group and VNet IDs after deployment.

.gitignore: Ensures local state files and provider binaries are not tracked.

⚙️ How to Use
1. Initialize and Login
PowerShell
az login
terraform init
2. Deploy to Development
PowerShell
terraform workspace new dev
terraform apply -auto-approve
3. Deploy to Test
PowerShell
terraform workspace new test
terraform apply -auto-approve
🧠 Why Workspaces?
Workspaces are superior to duplicate folders because they allow you to reuse the exact same code for different stages of the infrastructure lifecycle. This reduces manual errors, ensures that "Test" is a true mirror of "Dev," and simplifies updates across the entire infrastructure.
